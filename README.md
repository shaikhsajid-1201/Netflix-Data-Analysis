## Project Overview

Netflix has a vast catalog of movies and TV shows across various genres and ratings. This project aims to analyze the distribution of content, understand genre popularity by country, evaluate the frequency of directors across genres, examine rating distributions, and identify trends in content additions over the years.

## Data

The analysis uses a cleaned version of Netflixâ€™s content data, structured with the following key columns:

- `Date_Added`: Date when content was added to Netflix
- `Release_Year`: Year the content was originally released
- `Rating`: Audience rating (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13)
- `Duration`: Duration (minutes for Movies, seasons for TV Shows)
- `Genre`: Genres or categories associated with the content

## Analysis

Key analysis queries include:
1. **Content Type Distribution**: Movie vs. TV show count
